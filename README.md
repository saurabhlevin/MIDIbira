Hardware 3D printing files and code for the M(IDI)bira controller: https://bluelungimagaa.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/midibira-finalfinal-pdf/

The code is only useful if you want to your controller to be velocity sensitive (you can still adjust velocity via the Mode button though)

For 3D printing:

2X shell_A1
1X all other parts
